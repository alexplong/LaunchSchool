=begin
Difficulty: medium

Write a function that takes an array of numbers (integers for the tests) and a target number. It should find two different items in the array that, when added together, give the target value. The indices of these items should then be returned in a tuple like so: (index1, index2).

The input will always be valid (numbers will be an array of length 2 or greater, and all of the items will be numbers; target will always be the sum of two different items from that array).

p two_sum([1, 2, 3], 4).sort == [0, 2]
p two_sum([1234, 5678, 9012], 14690).sort == [1, 2]
p two_sum([2, 2, 3], 4).sort == [0, 1]
