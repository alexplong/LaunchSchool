=begin
## Difficulty: hard

You are given an array that contains only integers (positive and negative). Your job is to sum only the numbers that are the same and consecutive. The result should be one array.

You can assume there is never an empty array and there will always be an integer.

=end
p sum_consecutives([1,4,4,4,0,4,3,3,1,1]) == [1,12,0,4,6,2]
p sum_consecutives([1,1,7,7,3]) == [2,14,3]
p sum_consecutives([-5,-5,7,7,12,0]) == [-10,14,12,0]
