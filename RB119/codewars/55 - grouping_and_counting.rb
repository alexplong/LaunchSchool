Your goal is to write the group_and_count method, which should receive an array as a unique parameter and return a hash. Empty or nil input must return nil instead of a hash. This hash returned must contain as keys the unique values of the array, and as values the counting of each value.

Example usage:

input = [1,1,2,2,2,3]

group_and_count(input)# == {1=>2, 2=>3, 3=>1}
The following methods were disabled:

Array#count
Array#length
=end
p group_and_count([1,1,2,2,2,3]) == {1=>2, 2=>3, 3=>1}
p group_and_count([]) == nil
p group_and_count(nil) == nil
p group_and_count([1, 7, 5, -1]) == {1=>1, 7=>1, 5=>1, -1=>1}
